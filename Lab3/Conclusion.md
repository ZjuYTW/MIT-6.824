<h1>Conclusion</h1>

Lab3 is a tough journey, especially when you finish the whole framework, then problem just starts. I took roughly two days to complete my draft and spent 2-3 times time to debug.

In order to remind me of this hard time, spending hours reading 20000 lines log, suspecting each line I wrote and make you who are reading this avoid bugs or debug smoothly, I will write problems as explicit as I can.

To make my design easy to understand, I will start with design graph.
