<h1>Frangipani(To be updaed)</h1>

<h2>Introduce</h2>

While Frangipani is a paper published in 1997, I just want to talk about cache consistency in detail.

The paper are mainly discussed following 3 aspects:

* cache coherence
* distributed transactions
* distributed crash recovery



<h2>Cache consistency</h2>

Rules for cache coherence

* No cached data without data's lock
* acquire lock then read from petal
* write to petal then release lock



<h2>Extends</h2>
