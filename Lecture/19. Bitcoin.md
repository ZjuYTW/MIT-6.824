<h1>Bitcoin</h1>

As mentioned in Satoshi Nakamoto's paper that bitcoin is aimed to prevent double-spending as well as reduce the cost of third party involvement. 

Bitcoin has three features that makes it Epoch-making

* Decentralization
* Using Peer-to-Peer Technology
* Low-cost transaction



<h2>Brief Intro </h2>

Bitcoin is a distributed ledger which implement decentralization. Bitcoin â€˜s design should solve Byzantine Generals Problem because it is running through public Internet. Bitcoin systems reply on *Proof of Work* to verify each node's validation to prove itself running on a true CPU. Bitcoin also promise that : Malicious nodes' blockchain won't grow long, if most of nodes in the network are meritorious.

For double-spending problem, block-chain ensures that even if blockchain may fork at some point, but only one fork will be accepted in the end.



<h3>Drawbacks</h3>

* Every new transaction need 10 min before recording on the blockchain
* The trustworthiness grows as the chain grows longer, but still have chance to be waived by receiving a longer chain from other node.
* Waste energy
